This is the second project that I've completed on my own with the guidance of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification track's final projects.

The task was to create a form - therefore I took inspiration from a survey I created for a group I run called Coding For Immigrants and converted the content from it to this format.

This is project 2 out of 5 from this certification track.
