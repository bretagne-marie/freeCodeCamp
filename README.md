# freeCodeCamp
This is the very first project I've completed on my own with the guidance of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification track's final projects.

 I wanted to ensure that the content I provided showcase someone I admired, so who better than to practice by spreading knowledge about the fantastic life of Josefine Baker!

 This is project 1 out of 5 from freeCodeCamp's certification track.
